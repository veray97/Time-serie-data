# State spce model + Kalman Filtering

## Summary:

State-space models are a powerful, flexible, and versatile class of models in the field of time series analysis. When combined with Kalman filtering techniques, they can encompass ARIMA models as well as many non-stationary models and models with exogenous variables

## Local Level Model:

**Local Level Model** is the simplest form of a state-space model used in time series analysis. It assumes that the observed data is generated from a latent (hidden) level that evolves slowly over time, with some randomness.
